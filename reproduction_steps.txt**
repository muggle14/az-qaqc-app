1. **Ensure the Dockerfile is in the Project Root:**
   Place the `Dockerfile` in the `my-swarm-agent/` directory.

2. **Build the Docker Image:**
   Open a terminal in the `my-swarm-agent/` directory and run:
   ```
   docker build -t my-swarm-agent:latest .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:**
   ```
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-swarm-agent:latest
   ```

4. **Access the Application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your Vite app running inside the Docker container.
```

**Additional Notes:**

- **Symlink Issues:** Docker can have trouble resolving symlinks, especially if they point outside the build context. Ensure that all symlinks within your project are valid and contained within the build context (`my-swarm-agent/`).

- **Permissions:** If you're on a Unix-like system, check the permissions of your files and directories:
  ```bash
  chmod -R 755 /path/to/my-swarm-agent
  ```

- **Docker BuildKit:** The deprecation warning suggests installing BuildKit. Update Docker to the latest version and consider using BuildKit for better performance:
  ```bash
  docker buildx build -t my-swarm-agent:latest .
  ```

**If further clarification is needed, please provide:**

- The exact `docker build` command you're using.
- The content of your existing `Dockerfile` if different from the one provided.
- Any specific errors after applying these fixes.
